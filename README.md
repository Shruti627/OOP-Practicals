# 📘 C++ OOP Practicals

This repository contains my C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) practicals, completed as part of my academic coursework. Each program demonstrates core OOP principles with clean, well-structured, and well-commented code, making it ideal for both practice and revision.

These practicals cover a wide range of key Object-Oriented Programming concepts:

- **📦 Classes & Objects** – Fundamental units of object-oriented design, showing how to define and work with real-world entities in code.
- **🔧 Constructors & Destructors** – Managing the lifecycle of objects with different types of constructors (default, parameterized, copy) and destructors.
- **🧬 Inheritance** – Reusing and extending class features through single, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance.
- **🎭 Polymorphism** – Demonstrating compile-time polymorphism using function and operator overloading, and runtime polymorphism using virtual functions.
- **🤝 Friend Functions** – Enabling controlled access between classes to illustrate inter-class relationships while preserving encapsulation.
- **🧱 Containment (Aggregation)** – Implementing the “Has-A” relationship by embedding one class within another, promoting modular design.
- **📊 Sorting Techniques** – Sorting data using class member functions, emphasizing encapsulation and real-world problem-solving with OOP.

Each code file is crafted to reinforce conceptual clarity, logical thinking, and coding best practices, making this repository a valuable resource for students and learners of C++.
